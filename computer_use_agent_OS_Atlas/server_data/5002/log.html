THOUGHT: The objective is: use the web browser to get the current weather in San Francisco.

On the screen, I see:
- A Google search for "San Francisco weather."
- The current temperature and weather forecast for San Francisco.
- Suggestions for related searches.
- Forecast display for different times and days.
- Links to weather sources like The Weather Channel and Google Weather.

This means the objective is: complete.
