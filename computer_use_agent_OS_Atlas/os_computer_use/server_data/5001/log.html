THOUGHT: The objective is: to find the best restaurants in Atlanta.

On the screen, I see: 
- A Google search results page for "best restaurants in Atlanta."
- A list of restaurants like Canoe, TWO urban licks, and Lazy Betty, with their ratings, price range, and brief descriptions.

This means the objective is: complete.
